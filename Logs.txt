Day 1:

Theoreticaly speaking I read alot of things... Consciously IDK what i read, but i'd like to think its somewhere in my subconscience just waiting to suprise me as soon as I start reading again.

Practically: 
	got electron: 
		A Nodejs framework that enables me to make desktop applications using web technologies... Parses html,css and js code. 
		Allows for communication between console(the application that it renders) and the main process(application that renders), seeing as how they are both 		connected.

	Learned a bit about urls after using requestjs, which is a node library used to send requests to remote server, it has a callback function that is capable of accessing the response.


	Used cheeriojs, A webscraping library that implents Jquery's simplistic Dom manipulation.

	Created basic gui that sends the form data to the main process.


Day 2(plan):

	Send valid data to main process.
	main process interprets data.
	data is used for query string for indeed
	add more options to gui.
